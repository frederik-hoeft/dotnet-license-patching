# dotnet-license-patching

An educational proof of concept project to demonstrate the futility of obfuscating .NET assemblies and to demonstrate the practical applicability of runtime patching using game modding tools like Harmony to a cybersecurity context.

> **DISCLAIMER**: This project is for educational purposes only. It serves as a practical demonstration of why "security through obscurity" is not a valid security measure in modern software development. The project is not intended to be used for malicious purposes or to facilitate software piracy. The project is not intended to be used to circumvent software licensing or to facilitate the use of software without a valid license. The hypothetical use case of circumventing software licensing in the way layed out by this proof of concept was only chosen due to the common application of obfuscation to this domain. The author does not condone the use of this project or the techniques described in this project for malicious purposes. The author does not take any responsibility for any misuse of this project or the techniques described in this project.
